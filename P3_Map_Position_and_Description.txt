Description of the Area:
Cheshire, England is in the midlands in England, it borders with Wales and the major cities nearby are Manchester
(to the north) and Sheffield (north east).

Reasons for Choice:
Since I am based in the UK I wanted to select an area in this country because I thought I would have a better 
understanding of the data in terms of postcode formats and typical street names.
I initially chose London however this cross-section of data was too large for my computer to process. Cheshire 
is an area I visited often, and since it is one of the lesser known areas in England, I thought there was a
possibility that data from this region would be less 'clean' and therefore more interesting to analyse.
